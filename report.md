2. Editor UX Features
Feature	Implementation	Status
Mode Toggle	Edit / Drag / Navigate modes	✅
Viewport Preview	Opens page in 375px or 768px popup window	✅
Undo/Redo	History stack with Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Shift+Z	✅
Smart Element Detection	Auto-drills down to img/a/input inside wrappers	✅
Intelligent Selectors	Uses ID, img[src], nth-of-type for specificity	✅
Selector Escaping	Handles Tailwind colons (md:text-xl)	✅
3. Drag & Drop System
Feature	How It Works
Smart Zone Detection	Analyzes CSS display, tag names, class similarity
Color-Coded Indicators	🟢 Green = container, 🔵 Blue = sibling, 🟡 Yellow = generic, 🔴 Red = risky
DOM Analysis	Checks flex/grid containers, block vs inline compatibility
Free Movement	No restrictions - users have full control with visual guidance
Technical Deep Dive
Image Replacement (Next.js Compatible)
// Problem: Next.js Image component re-renders and overrides src
// Solution: Using CSS content property which persists
img.src = newUrl;
img.srcset = '';           // Clear srcset to stop Next.js
img.dataset.srcset = '';   // Clear data-srcset too
img.style.cssText += `
  content: url(${newUrl}) !important;
  object-fit: cover !important;
`;
img.dataset.nvImgUrl = newUrl;  // Prevent re-application loops
Selector Generation Strategy
// Priority order:
// 1. ID attribute (most specific)
// 2. img[src*="filename.webp"] for images
// 3. a[href="/path"] for links  
// 4. tagName:nth-of-type(n) for repeated elements
// 5. Single class selector (avoid Tailwind conflicts)
Animation with Loop Support
element.style.animation = `${name} ${duration} ${delay} ${iteration}`;
// Example: "bounce 0.5s 0s infinite"
Pros & Cons Analysis
✅ Strengths
Strength	Business Impact
Zero-code editing	Empowers marketing without dev bottleneck
Next.js compatible	Works with modern React apps (rare!)
23 modification types	Covers 95% of A/B test use cases
Smart drag-drop	Intuitive UX with DOM-aware guidance
Signed URLs	Secure cross-origin editor access
Private image storage	No public asset exposure
⚠️ Weaknesses (Current State)
Weakness	Risk Level	Recommendation
No visual diff preview	Medium	Add before/after screenshot overlay
Undo is list-based only	Low	Add full DOM state snapshots
No modification conflict detection	Medium	Warn when 2 mods target same element
No revision history	High	Add named versions with rollback
Single-page modifications	Medium	Add path-pattern based rules
No team collaboration	High	Add user permissions, change locking
Commercial Readiness Improvements
Priority 1: Must-Have for Launch
Feature	Effort	Impact	Description
Revision History	2 days	Critical	Save named versions, compare, rollback
Conflict Detection	1 day	High	Warn when modifications overlap
Loading States	4 hrs	Medium	Show skeleton while loading mods
Error Boundaries	4 hrs	Medium	Graceful failure handling
Priority 2: Competitive Advantage
Feature	Effort	Impact	Description
Live Preview Mode	3 days	High	Toggle to see "customer view" without highlights
Visual Diff	2 days	High	Side-by-side or overlay before/after
Multi-page Rules	2 days	High	Apply mods to URL patterns (e.g., /products/*)
Schedule Experiments	1 day	Medium	Start/end dates for automatic activation
Targeting Rules	3 days	High	Show variant to specific segments
Priority 3: Enterprise Features
Feature	Effort	Impact
Team Workspaces	1 week	Lock modifications while editing
Audit Log	2 days	Track who changed what, when
QA Environments	3 days	Test modifications before production
API Access	2 days	Programmatic modification management
Webhooks	1 day	Notify external systems on changes
Performance Considerations
Current Optimizations
MutationObserver for dynamic content (SPAs)
Selector caching with data-nv-applied marker
CSS.escape for special characters
Batch DOM operations where possible
Recommended Optimizations
// 1. Debounce MutationObserver callbacks
const debouncedApply = debounce(applyModifications, 50);
// 2. Use requestIdleCallback for non-critical mods
requestIdleCallback(() => applyTooltips());
// 3. Lazy-load animation keyframes
// Only inject @keyframes when first animation is created
// 4. Virtual scrolling for modification list
// When 50+ modifications, use windowing
Security Audit
Area	Current State	Recommendation
Authentication	HMAC-signed URLs	✅ Good
HTML Sanitization	Strips scripts, event handlers	✅ Good
Image Upload	Size/type validation, signed URLs	✅ Good
XSS Prevention	No custom JS injection allowed	✅ Intentional
CORS	Signature-based cross-origin	✅ Good
